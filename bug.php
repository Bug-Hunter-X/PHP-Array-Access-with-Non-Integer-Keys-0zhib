This code attempts to access an array element using a non-integer key. In PHP, array keys are typically integers, unless you're using associative arrays.  If you use a string key in an array that hasn't been explicitly set as an associative array using [], the behavior is unexpected and may result in a Notice or an incorrect result. 
```php
<?php
$myArray = [10, 20, 30];
echo $myArray["hello"]; // Notice: Undefined index: hello in ...
?>
```
