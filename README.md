This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP: attempting to access array elements using non-integer keys.  While associative arrays are a powerful feature, this example shows the pitfalls of accidentally using string keys when the array is intended to be numerically indexed. The solution demonstrates proper handling of numeric and associative arrays to prevent unexpected behavior.
